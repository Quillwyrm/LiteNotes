# LiteNotes

LiteNotes is a lightweight developer-notes system for Lite XL.  
It provides a **single dedicated notes/view panel** capable of:

- Per-project notes (stored externally)
- Viewing any `.md` file in a readable, styled mode
- (Optional / future) Creating new Markdown notes inside a project

The panel always exists **as a single instance**:  
commands simply **retarget** it to a different underlying document.
