A lightweight markdown viewer and developer-notes system for [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl).  
It provides a **single dedicated notes panel** capable of:


- Per-project notes (stored externally)
- Viewing any `.md` file in a readable, styled mode
- Editing an `.md` file by double clicking the notes panel
- [x] cool as hell
